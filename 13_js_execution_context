initially the js file is kept in a global execution context
for browser the value of this comes window
Types of execution context:
1. Global execution context
2. Function execution context
3. eval execution context

when a js file runs
phase 1: global execution -> this created
phase 2: memory phase - initializes all the variables with undefined
phase 3: execution phase -> if a function comes a new variable environemnt + thread is created with its memory and execution phase
            when this completes the new variable environemnt is deleted
